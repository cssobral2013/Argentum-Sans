# Argentum-Sans
Argentum Sans (Latin for "Silver") is a sans-serif geometric font forked from Montserrat version 5.001. This project was born following the two weight changes in 2017 on upstream fonts, so we created this font as a response. The first modifications are a lowercase l with a tail from alternate glyphs, and fixed some glyphs.

It supports the following blocks: Afrikaans, Baltic, Basic Latin, Catalan, Central European, Dutch, Esperanto, Euro, Igbo Onwu, Romanian, Turkish, Vietnamese and Western European (900+ glyphs per face).
