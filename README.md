Fork of Montserrat font, version 5
It all started when I've perceived the font Montserrat suffered two changes of weight in less than 1 year. Inspirated by
bringing back the good old spirit of the Montserrat typeface, this project was born. But, different than Montserrat version 7.2
(the version that, as of this writing, is on Google Fonts), this font has tabular figures as default.

It supports more than 100 Latin languages including Vietnamese, also all other features of the original Montserrat version 5 
(except the tabular figures) were mantained untouched.
